# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project: collect, work with, and clean a data set.

## a. The Original Dataset
The work name is "_Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0_" performed by Reyes-Ortiz J.L., Anguita D., Ghio A., Oneto L. in **Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory** (Genova, Italy). You can go to the [link](www.smartlab.ws) or download it from [data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). Summarizing the experiment:

* 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years;
* six activities wearing a smartphone;
* data captured from embedded accelerometer and gyroscope;
* 70% of volunteers for the training data, 30% for the test data.


## b. The Data
There are two principal datasets, **train** and **test**, that have the same features:

* triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer and the estimated body acceleration;
* triaxial angular velocity from the gyroscope;
* a 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables;
* its activity label;
* an identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

For further information, download the data and read original README.txt or contact _activityrecognition@smartlab.ws_. If you are lazy, there's a renamed version of the original file, README_Original.txt, inside the public [repository](https://github.com/Geggio80/GettingAndCleaningData).


## c. Work On Data
In order to complete the assigned project, it will be explained every step computed in R environment with RStudio in the **run_analysis.R**:

1. After (external) dowloading the data and putting them in the right workspace, it has been used **_read.table_** to read and load them (data,activities,subjects and features);

2. Using regular expression function **_grep_**, they have been chosen mean and standard deviation data (**ATTENTION:** to be more precise, _meanFreq feature_ is different from the previous data, because it's an average on a frequency component, not a single values mean);

3. Using regular espression function **_sub_**, features names have been cleaned up and adjusted, following the "Camel Case" notation;

4. Chosen data and cleaned up features have been merged together with **_rbind_** and **_cbind_** functions;

5. New dataset has been order for subjects and activities with **_order_** and activities numbers have been replaced with their names using **_within_** (casting them as factor);

6. **_aggregate_** function has been used for obtaining mean values over all the data, for subject and for activity, in order to obtain the final tidy dataset;

7. the final tidy dataset has been stored in a tab delimited file "Overall_Mean_Data.txt" with **_write.table_**.


## d. The Final Tidy Dataset
It has 180 observations x 68 variables: every observation is ordered at first for subject, then for activity about columns 1,2. Others 66 columns represent mean values over the original catched features and they keep features names on which mean has been performed.
