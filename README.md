# AN OVERVIEW ON THE R CODE

## Repository
There are five files:
1. _run_analysis.R_: R code;
2. _CodeBook.md_: explained steps of the work
3. _README.md_: a brief overview on R code;
4. _README_Original.txt_: original dataset README file;
5. _Overall_Mean_Data_: output of the R code;

## R Scripts
Only one script has been writed for the work: **_run_analysis.R_**.

## Libraries
Only standard libraries from _R Studio_ Version 0.98.501 (_R_ Version 3.0.3 64 bit) have been used.

## Variables
A list of the variables in the script:
* train, test: original data;
* activity_train, activity_test: related activities as identification number;
* subject_train, subject_test: related subjects as identification number;
* features: list of the experiment features
* activities: match beetween identification numbers and names;
* features_eff = chosen features;
* index_feat, names_feat: features names and indices;
* train_data, test_data: merging of data with features;
* overall_data: pre-final dataset;
* overall_mean_data: final dataset;

## Input and Output
**Input**: various .txt file previously downloaded;
**Output**: tidy dataset **_Overall_Mean_Data.txt_**;

## How The Script Works
Briefly:
1. Store all the data;
2. Chose and rename the features;
3. Merge data with features;
4. Order the data and label the activities;
5. Extract a new dataset;
6. Write the new dataset on a file;
